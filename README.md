#🌦️ Weather Analysis using AI

This project focuses on Weather Analysis using Artificial Intelligence, where I explored how AI can be leveraged to analyze, interpret, and predict weather patterns. The goal was to build an intelligent system that can handle historical weather data and provide meaningful insights through visualization and AI-driven prediction models.

🔍 Features
Data collection and preprocessing of historical weather datasets

Exploratory data analysis with graphs and visualizations

Temperature, humidity, and precipitation trend analysis

Machine Learning models for weather prediction (e.g., temperature, rain likelihood)

Interactive visual dashboards (optional, if included)

Performance evaluation and comparison of multiple models

🧠 Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (ML models)

Jupyter Notebook

(Optional: Streamlit/Flask for visualization interface)

🚀 Objectives
Understand weather patterns using historical data

Apply machine learning techniques to forecast weather elements

Gain insights from AI in climate-related decision making
